Cut and paste:

Position the cursor where you want to begin cutting.
Press v to select characters, or uppercase V to select whole lines, or Ctrl-v to select rectangular blocks (use Ctrl-q if Ctrl-v is mapped to paste).
Move the cursor to the end of what you want to cut.
Press d to cut (or y to copy).
Move to where you would like to paste.
Press P to paste before the cursor, or p to paste after.
Copy and paste is performed with the same steps except for step 4 where you would press y instead of d:

d stands for delete in Vim, which in other editors is usually called cut
y stands for yank in Vim, which in other editors is usually called copy
